My path in this specific discipline has been marked by a constant pursuit of knowledge as well as an unending enthusiasm for change. Thriving in various aspects of electrical engineering like circuit design, signal processing, programming languages mainly C++ and Python, and control systems have prompted me to join vibrant engineering groups ready to tackle complex problems. The academic milestones I have achieved show both my technical ability and commitment to lifelong learning. During my time at university, I consistently sought ways to enhance my skillset and broaden my understanding of emerging technologies. This is because whether it is through research studies, class work or extra curriculum activities I always strive to be outstandingly ahead in this field. I stand for well-roundedness in life other than my academic endeavors. I get immersed in literature and this is what makes me happy since it provides me with different perspectives and stories. Moreover, nature has always been a strong attraction for me, as I try to engage myself in various exhilarating activities like running and hiking when time allows. Equally important, I adore some types of music because they allow me to relax and relieve stress especially after a long day of studying hard or solving complicated mathematical problems. I love travelling not only because it exposes me to diverse cultures, foods, clothing and even technology but also because it helps grow my own self-identity. My perception of globalization on the other hand widened due to the opportunities I had while abroad. Being dedicated to giving back to my community, I take part in volunteer initiatives and sports activities actively. I think it is important that I use what I have acquired through my skills and resources to positively influence the world around me; this may involve mentoring aspiring engineers, helping out at local shelters or organizing charity events. In the future, I am very excited about applying my technical expertise and enthusiasm for innovation towards new engineering frontiers. Whether it's creating cutting edge technologies, addressing real-life problems or inspiring future engineers, I want to make a change by all means possible leaving behind something worthwhile.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI am Meshal Alotaibi, currently in my final phase of an Electrical Engineering degree at the University of New Mexico.
