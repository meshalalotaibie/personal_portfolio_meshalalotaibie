Dear Customer Service,

I am writing to express my great disappointment with recent experience I had with Wylink's new product, the AI Toolkit. As an existing customer, I had high expectations for this innovative tool, but unfortunately, my experience fell short.

One of the main issues I encountered was the AI Toolkit's lack of compatibility with certain devices. Despite efforts to integrate it into our existing systems, we experienced significant challenges with connectivity and functionality. This has been quite frustrating and has impacted our capability to streamline operations and leverage the complete potential of this AI Toolkit. I believe that to improve their compatibility with a broad range of devices, Wylink would consider enhancing the requirements for compatibility by updating them to include the wider range of browsers, operating systems, and specifications of the hardware commonly employed by clienteles. Also, developing the enhanced Software Development Kit (SDK) which gives the clear guidelines and support for AI Toolkit integration into several devices and platforms would be quite beneficial. Undertaking thorough compatibility testing with various devices, operating systems, and the versions of software, and offering regular firmware updates to address issues of compatibility and enhance performance on diverse devices, could also be important. Simplifying the process of configuration for this AI Toolkit and offering comprehensive documentation with a step-by-step instruction for troubleshooting compatibility issues and integration would further improve the user experience.

I understand that the new products could a times have various challenges, and I hope that my feedback could contribute to enhancing the AI Toolkit for the future users. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the various steps Wylink would take to address such issues.

Sincerely,

Mark Luten
