# *`SLO Reflection`*

When preparing my presentation about integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into higher education I used visuals purposefully to facilitate the comprehension of my ideas and make sure the report delivered that information that was captivating and educational. Among other things, I tried to use pictures and symbols that were connected to the subject of AI education. For instance, visualization of robots in classrooms, AI-enabled analytics platforms, and a virtual learning environment were depicted to give real-life scenario for the abstract ideas in the text. Such visual aids acted as operational demonstrations of AI applications, and thus, helped to fill in the theoretical explanation with the actual use. These images certainly assisted in making the transmission of information detailed and visualizing the interaction between different systems, which otherwise could be very intricate when mentioned only using words or writing down text.

I basically found out during this project a lot about the interaction between the graphics and information in writing. Visual elements function as both visual supports for the written text and also present information more efficiently than the written content would do. They perform the function of landmarks and anchors that draw attention; on the other hand, they serve for memory consolidating the message being transmitted. It is a visual and auditory presentation medium, and inherently, the synergy between these components is needed to ensure clarity of communication and effective engagement of the audience.

When it comes to technological expertise, I acquired multiple new skills along my journey in the implementation of this project. I capitalized on my skills in Power Point, being able to use advanced features such as custom animations and transitions which were necessary in order to give the presentation a more dynamic personality and keep every audience member engaged. My skill set also expanded as I became familiar with data visualization software that assisted me in creating charts and graphs directly from my spreadsheets. This, in turn, helped in the process of converting raw information into the needed presentation form. Moreover, I regularly practiced working with the different graphical tools to alter images or make diagrams that perfectly complemented the content I was presenting. These technological skills not only improved the quality of my current project but also equipped me with valuable tools for future professional presentations and reports.
